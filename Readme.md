# AI Painting App
We are making an app that will track our hand and helps us to draw from that. We will be using the advance knowledge of **Machine Learning**. The programming language that we will use is Python. I am using **Python V03.07**. Go to the [installation](https://www.python.org/) web page if you do not have the python installed.
## Hand tracking
### Installation guide:
Now for basic installation we need two packages. You can use `pip install` or you can just directly download
* [OpenCV-pyhton](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/)
* [Mediapipe](https://pypi.org/project/mediapipe/)
### Run:
After installing the whole thing just run the `paint.py` file. It has a canvas and camera for painting.
